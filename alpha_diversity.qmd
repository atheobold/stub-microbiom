## Exploring with Transformations
<!-- And then we can calculate alpha diversity as a function of Season. Species richness would be a simple metric, but we could play with other alpha diversity metrics that take int account abundance. This is where trying different transformations could be interesting. -->

## Visualizing Species Classes over Time

<!-- Finally, we talked about creating bar plots of the different classes within samples and facet gridding by month or year. This would enable the students to visually think about similar communities. -->
