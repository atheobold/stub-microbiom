I've highlighted with green the most relevant columns from our discussion. It wouldn't let me attach it as I guess it was too big. Let me know if you have trouble with it.

As I mentioned, each row is a species. However, for our purposes, I think we should look at the class level. So that will be our taxonomy unit.

The SAMPLE will be important. I now realize we will have to do a bit of spreadsheet cleaning as we will need to merge everything to the class level within a sample.

The value will be the number of counts of a class (but right now that's not the case since the taxa are separated deeper than class, hence why we'll need to merge them).
